# Heart Disease Analysis Project
## ALU BSE - ML Techniques II Assignment

### Project Overview
This project analyzes heart disease patient data using unsupervised learning techniques to identify risk groups and patterns. The analysis uses the UCI Heart Disease dataset to cluster patients based on their medical history and identify risk factors associated with heart disease.

### Dataset Information
- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Size**: 303 instances, 14 attributes
- **Target**: Heart disease presence (0 = absent, 1-4 = present)
- **Key Features**: Age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.

### Installation and Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/thedavidemmanuel/heart-disease-analysis.git

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Analysis Tasks
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Data loading and inspection
   - Statistical summaries
   - Feature distributions
   - Correlation analysis
   - Missing value assessment

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Missing value imputation
   - Categorical variable encoding
   - Feature scaling
   - Data quality verification

3. **Clustering Analysis**
   - K-means clustering with optimal k selection
   - Hierarchical clustering with dendrogram analysis
   - DBSCAN clustering with parameter optimization

4. **Dimensionality Reduction**
   - PCA for feature importance analysis
   - t-SNE for non-linear relationships
   - Cluster visualization and interpretation

5. **Risk Factor Analysis**
   - Gaussian Mixture Models
   - Component analysis
   - Risk group profiling

6. **Performance Evaluation**
   - Silhouette score analysis
   - Davies-Bouldin index comparison
   - Algorithm performance comparison

7. **Results and Conclusions**
   - Best algorithm selection
   - Clinical implications
   - Risk stratification insights

### Key Findings
1. **Risk Groups Identified**:
   - High Risk (5.61%): Multiple risk factors present
   - Moderate Risk (67.99%): Regular monitoring needed
   - Low Risk (26.40%): Preventive care focus

2. **Best Performing Algorithm**: Hierarchical Clustering
   - Silhouette Score: 0.1565
   - Davies-Bouldin Index: 2.1155
   - Natural patient grouping capability

3. **Principal Risk Factors**:
   - Exercise-induced indicators (ST depression, angina)
   - Vessel involvement
   - Heart rate variations

### Technical Implementation
- **Programming Language**: Python 3
- **Key Libraries**:
  - pandas: Data manipulation
  - scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms
  - matplotlib/seaborn: Visualization
  - numpy: Numerical computations

### Requirements
```
pandas>=1.3.0
numpy>=1.21.0
scikit-learn>=0.24.2
matplotlib>=3.4.2
seaborn>=0.11.1
ucimlrepo>=0.0.3
```

### Notebook Structure
Each task is clearly delineated in the Jupyter notebook with:
1. Markdown cells indicating task numbers and objectives
2. Code cells with implementation
3. Output cells with results and visualizations
4. Analysis cells with interpretations

### Visualization Outputs
The analysis includes multiple visualization types:
- Distribution plots for features
- Correlation heatmaps
- Cluster visualizations
- Dimensionality reduction plots
- Performance metric comparisons

### Future Improvements
1. **Analysis Extensions**:
   - Additional clustering algorithms
   - More advanced feature engineering
   - Time-series analysis for patient monitoring

2. **Technical Enhancements**:
   - Interactive visualizations
   - Model deployment capabilities
   - Real-time prediction system
